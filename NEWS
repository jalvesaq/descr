 - New arguments for CrossTable and crosstab:
   row.labels, percent, total.c and total.r.

Version 1.1.1 (2015-05-06)
--------------------------

Version 1.1 (2015-04-13)
--------------------------

  Change:

    - The plot.CrossTable() function now plots a mosaic graphic with rows and
      columns that mirror the output table. The x and y arguments of
      crosstab() were renamed indep and dep, respectively, to avoid the
      confusion with what should be xlab and ylab. The arguments
      user.missing.x and user.missing.y were also renamed.

  Bug fix:

    - Use format.pval() to print p-value in print.CrossTable().

Version 1.0.4 (2014-11-04)
--------------------------

  Bug fixes:

    - R/labels2R.R: Accept negative values.

    - R/xtable.R: Add row and column total proportions to xtable (thanks to
      Johannes Herrmann for reporting the bug).

  Changes:

    - New argument for compmeans: missing.include (thanks to Olivier Armand
      for reporting the issue that led to this change).

    - New argument for CrossTable: drop.levels.

    - New option: descr.na.replacement.

Version 1.0.3 (2014-08-01)
--------------------------

--------------------------

  Bug fixes:

    - Allow to change the values of xlim and ylim in histkdnc(). Thanks to
      Thomas W. MacFarland for reporting the bug.

  Changes:

    - Make CrossTable() to print residuals even if format="SAS".

    - Make CrossTable() to print only what is set to TRUE.

    - CrossTable() doesn't output chisq.test() warnings if chisq = FALSE and
      prop.chisq = FALSE.

    - News functions: data.frame2txt() and labels2R().

Version 1.0.1 (2013-01-15)
--------------------------

  Bug fix:

    - src/fwf2csv.c: Free no longer used allocated memory.

    - Implement weighted boxplot for compmeans (code written by Stefan Kraft
      for the simPopulation package).

  Change:

    - Add option to suppress warnings: "descr.warn".


Version 1.0.0 (2012-11-18)
--------------------------

  Bug fix:

    - src/fwf2csv.c: Don't cause stack smashing if field is wider than 255
      characters (thanks to Anthony Damico for reporting the bug).

    - No longer produce weighted box plots.

Version 0.9.7 (2011-12-12)
--------------------------

  Changes:

    - Boxplot made by compmeans now have relative widths and the boxes have
      gray color.

    - Adapt the width of cross tables to options("width").

  Bug fix:

    - CrossTable, crosstab and compmeans: Correctly calculate widths if the
      text is in Chinese (thanks to Wincent Ronggui Huang for reporting the
      bug).

    - print.CrossTable() and xtable.CrossTable(): handle the argument dnn,
      which was being ignored.

Version 0.4.2 (2011-11-24)

      dependency on odfWeave which currently is not installable on Windows.

  Bug fix:

    - CrossTable(): Improve documentation about default values of chisq,
      resid, sresid, and asresid. Set the value of expected to TRUE if

      plot methods.


Version 0.3.3 (2011-02-08)
--------------------------

  Changes:

    - compmeans(): When sort=T the boxplots are sorted too.
                   Uses wtd.boxplot of package NEmisc.
                   Returns a matrix instead of a list.
    
    - freq(): Returns a matrix instead of a list.

    - Changed the dependency of xtable from Depends to Imports.

    - fwf2csv: Only prints message about number of lines saved 
      if the value of "verbose" option is TRUE.

Version 0.3.2 (2009-10-11)
--------------------------

  Bug fixes:

    - Fixed documentation link to read.fwf().

    - Added domain = "R-descr" to all gettext().

      and R was running on Linux. Also fixed reading of strings with spaces.

  Changes:

    - Inverted colors in the mosaic plot produced by crosstab().

    - Only add cumulative percent to frequency table if the object is "ordered".

    - print.CrossTable():
        - Removed the message "Total Observations in Table", since the number is
          printed in the table anyway.
        - Removed vertical bars from the output to give room for longer
          factor labels.
        - getOption("OutDec") now is used to format the numbers.
        - Expected frequency now is always printed with one decimal digit.

  New features:

      before read.table()).

    - Included a version of CrossTable, adapted from gmodels package, with
      methods for print and xtable.
