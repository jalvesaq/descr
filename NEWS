Version 1.1.1 (2015-05-05)
--------------------------

  - Bug fixes in forODFTable() and xtable.CrossTable().

Version 1.1 (2015-04-13)
--------------------------

  Change:

    - The plot.CrossTable() function now plots a mosaic graphic with rows and
      columns that mirror the output table. The x and y arguments of
      crosstab() were renamed indep and dep, respectively, to avoid the
      confusion with what should be xlab and ylab. The arguments
      user.missing.x and user.missing.y were also renamed.

  Bug fix:

    - Use format.pval() to print p-value in print.CrossTable().

Version 1.0.4 (2014-11-04)
--------------------------

  Bug fixes:

    - R/labels2R.R: Accept negative values.

    - R/xtable.R: Add row and column total proportions to xtable (thanks to
      Johannes Herrmann for reporting the bug).

  Changes:

    - New argument for compmeans: missing.include (thanks to Olivier Armand
      for reporting the issue that led to this change).

    - New argument for CrossTable: drop.levels.

    - New option: descr.na.replacement.

Version 1.0.3 (2014-08-01)
--------------------------

  Bug fixes:

    - R/labels2R.R: Avoid infinite loop.

    - R/xtable.R: Avoid errors when either sresid or prop.chisq are TRUE.

    - src/descr.c: Read up to 32765 characters from input lines.

Version 1.0.2 (2013-11-01)
--------------------------

  Bug fixes:

    - R/xtable.R: Fix column name "Total" and deal with "$" in label names.

    - Allow to change the values of xlim and ylim in histkdnc(). Thanks to
      Thomas W. MacFarland for reporting the bug.

  Changes:

    - Make CrossTable() to print residuals even if format="SAS".

    - Make CrossTable() to print only what is set to TRUE.

    - CrossTable() doesn't output chisq.test() warnings if chisq = FALSE and
      prop.chisq = FALSE.

    - News functions: data.frame2txt() and labels2R().

Version 1.0.1 (2013-01-15)
--------------------------

  Bug fix:

    - src/fwf2csv.c: Free no longer used allocated memory.

    - Implement weighted boxplot for compmeans (code written by Stefan Kraft
      for the simPopulation package).

  Change:

    - Add option to suppress warnings: "descr.warn".


Version 1.0.0 (2012-11-18)
--------------------------

  Bug fix:

    - src/fwf2csv.c: Don't cause stack smashing if field is wider than 255
      characters (thanks to Anthony Damico for reporting the bug).

Version 0.9.9 (2012-09-24)
--------------------------

  Bug fix:

    - Sort boxplots widths in compmeans if sort = TRUE.

Version 0.9.8 (2012-08-06)
--------------------------

  Changes:

    - New argument for CrossTable(): cell.layout.

    - No longer produce weighted box plots.

Version 0.9.7 (2011-12-12)
--------------------------

  Changes:

    - Boxplot made by compmeans now have relative widths and the boxes have
      gray color.

    - Adapt the width of cross tables to options("width").

  Bug fix:

    - CrossTable, crosstab and compmeans: Correctly calculate widths if the
      text is in Chinese (thanks to Wincent Ronggui Huang for reporting the
      bug).

    - print.CrossTable() and xtable.CrossTable(): handle the argument dnn,
      which was being ignored.

Version 0.4.2 (2011-11-24)
--------------------------

  Changes:

    - Replace method odfTable.CrossTable with function forODFTable to avoid
      dependency on odfWeave which currently is not installable on Windows.

  Bug fix:

    - CrossTable(): Improve documentation about default values of chisq,
      resid, sresid, and asresid. Set the value of expected to TRUE if
      residuals are requested (thanks for David Carlson for reporting the
      bugs).


Version 0.4.1 (2011-09-06)
--------------------------

  Bug fix:

    - file.head(): Does not fail if file encoding is Latin1 or other single
                   byte encoding and system encoding is UTF-8 (thanks to

Version 0.4.0 (2011-06-25)
--------------------------

  Changes:

    - odfTable method for object of class CrossTable.

    - Improved xtable method for object of class CrossTable.


Version 0.3.4 (2011-04-24)
--------------------------

  Changes:

    - Objects of classes meanscomp, freqtable and CrossTable now have
      plot methods.


Version 0.3.3 (2011-02-08)
--------------------------

  Changes:

    - compmeans(): When sort=T the boxplots are sorted too.
                   Uses wtd.boxplot of package NEmisc.
                   Returns a matrix instead of a list.
    
    - freq(): Returns a matrix instead of a list.

    - Changed the dependency of xtable from Depends to Imports.

    - fwf2csv: Only prints message about number of lines saved 
      if the value of "verbose" option is TRUE.

  New features:

    - Added argument user.missing to freq(), compmeans(), and crosstab().


Version 0.3.2 (2009-10-11)
--------------------------

  Bug fixes:

    - Fixed documentation link to read.fwf().

    - Added domain = "R-descr" to all gettext().

    - Fixed conversion of fwf into csv when the fwf had \r\n line terminators
      and R was running on Linux. Also fixed reading of strings with spaces.

  Changes:

    - Inverted colors in the mosaic plot produced by crosstab().

    - Only add cumulative percent to frequency table if the object is "ordered".

    - print.CrossTable():
        - Removed the message "Total Observations in Table", since the number is
          printed in the table anyway.
        - Removed vertical bars from the output to give room for longer
          factor labels.
        - getOption("OutDec") now is used to format the numbers.
        - Expected frequency now is always printed with one decimal digit.

  New features:

    - Added function file.head(), which shows the first lines of a file (useful
      before read.table()).


Version 0.3.1 (2009-08-11)
--------------------------

  New features:

    - Included a version of CrossTable, adapted from gmodels package, with
      methods for print and xtable.

    - Added xtable methods for classes freqtable and meanscomp.


Version 0.3.0 (2009-06-07)
--------------------------

  New features:

    - Added plot option to crosstab, compmeans and freq.

    - Renamed function crosstabs to crosstab.

    - LogRegR2 now accepts "probit" models.

  Bug fixes:

    - Fixed bug in the weighted standard deviation calculus in compmeans.
